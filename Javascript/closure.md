# Closure

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

Why would you use one?

- Data privacy / emulating private methods with closures. Commonly used in the module pattern.
- Partial applications or currying.
