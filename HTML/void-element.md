HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example `<br />`, `<img />`, `<hr />`, etc.

- What are HTML Entities?

In HTML some characters are reserved like ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘/’, etc. To use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character entities called HTML Entities.

For example, if you use the less-than (<) sign, the browser interprets any text that follows as a tag.
